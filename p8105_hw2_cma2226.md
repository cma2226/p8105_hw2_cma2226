## **Problem 1**

I will load the required packages for the three homework problems.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

In this problem I will be using the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset. I will
begin by reading in and cleaning the dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx(
    "./problem_1&2_datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
#clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
#drop NAs
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
#round and make sports_balls variable an integer
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls) 
  )
```

Now I will read and clean the precipitation data for 2018 and 2017 from
other sheets within the same excel file. I will clean the names, skip
the first row, drop NA’s in the month variable, create a year variable,
and relocate year to the first column.

``` r
precip_2018 =
  read_excel(
      "./problem_1&2_datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
      sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
      skip = 1
  ) %>%
  #clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  #Drop NAs in the month column
  drop_na(month) %>%
  #create a year variable to denote 2018 data
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  #move year variable to the first column
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 =
  read_excel(
      "./problem_1&2_datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
      sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
      skip = 1
  ) %>%
  #clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  #drop NAs in the month variable
  drop_na(month) %>%
  #create a year variable to denote 2018 data
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  #move year variable to the first column
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine 2017 and 2018 annual precipitation datasets

``` r
precip_df =
  # use bind rows to add datasets together
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017) %>%
  #change month number to month name
   mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "January", "2" = "February", "3" = "March", "4" = "April", "5" = "May", "6" = "June", "7" = "July", "8" = "August", "9" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December"))
```

In summary, the trashwheel dataset contains information from the
Mr. Trash Wheel trash collector based in Baltimore Maryland. The
trashwheel collects trash as it enters the inner harbor and stores it in
a dumpster. The dataset contains information on the volume and type of
trash collected by year and month. There are a total of 344 rows and 14
columns in our final trashwheel dataset. Key variables in the final
trashwheel dataset include month, year, weight (tons), volume (cubic
yards), number of sports balls, and quantity measures of other specific
types of trash.

We can calculate the median number of sports balls found per month in
2017, and the total number of sports balls found in 2017 as follows:

``` r
trash_2017 = filter(trashwheel_df, year == "2017")
median(pull(trash_2017, sports_balls))
```

    ## [1] 8

``` r
sum(pull(trash_2017, sports_balls))
```

    ## [1] 530

The final merged precipitation dataset contains monthly precipitation
measurements for 2017 and 2018. There are a total of 24 rows and 3
columns in this dataset. Key variables include month, year, and total
precipitation. We can calculate total precipitation in 2018 as follows:

``` r
precip_2018 = filter(precip_df, year == "2018")
sum(pull(precip_2018, total))
```

    ## [1] 70.33

### **Problem 2**

First I will read and clean in the transit data file.

``` r
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
transit = 
  read_csv("./problem_1&2_datasets/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  #clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  #select desired data elements
  select(line, station_name, station_location, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  #convert entry variable from character to logical variable
  mutate(entry = as.logical(recode(entry, "YES" = "TRUE", "NO" = "FALSE")))
```

This dataset contains information related to the New York City subway
routes and stations. Important data elements include subway lines,
location, routes, entrance type and ADA compliance for each listed
subway station. There are a total of 1868 rows and 18 columns in the
transit dataset.

In my above code chunk, I first standardized my variables to have lower
snake case naming convention. I then selected the desired data elements:
line, station name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry,
vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance variables. Lastly, I
converted the entry variable from a character variable to a logical
variable. We can verify that the entry variable is logical using the
following code:

``` r
typeof(transit$entry)
```

    ## [1] "logical"

Now I will determine the number of distinct stations using the distinct
function, which removes duplicate rows in a dataframe.

``` r
nrow(distinct(transit))
```

    ## [1] 684

Now I will determine the number of ADA compliant stations.

``` r
nrow(distinct(filter(transit, ada == TRUE)))
```

    ## [1] 179

What proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
vend.table = table(pull(filter(distinct(transit), vending == "NO"), entry))
prop.table(vend.table)
```

    ## 
    ##     FALSE      TRUE 
    ## 0.6153846 0.3846154

38.46% of stations without vending allow entrance.

How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of those that serve the A
train, how many are ADA compliant?

First I will reformat data so that route number and route name are
distinct variables.

``` r
transit = 
  #convert all route variables to characters in order to facilitate reformatting using pivot_longer
  mutate(transit, route8 = as.character(route8), route9 = as.character(route9),
         route10 = as.character(route10), route11 = as.character(route11)) %>%
  #reformat data such that route number is in one column and train is in another
  pivot_longer(
    cols = route1:route11,
    names_to = "route", 
    values_to = "train") %>%
  mutate(route = recode(route, "route1" = "1", "route2" = "2", "route3" = "3", "route4" = "4", "route5" = "5", "route6" = "6", "route7" = "7", "route8" = "8", "route9" = "9", "route10" = "10", "route11" = "11"))
#determine the number of distinct stations that serve the A train
nrow(distinct(filter(transit, train == "A")))
```

    ## [1] 91

``` r
#determine the number of ADA compliant stations that serve the A train
A_train = distinct(filter(transit, train == "A"))
nrow(filter(A_train, ada == "TRUE"))
```

    ## [1] 34

There are 91 distinct stations that serve the A train. There are 34 ADA
compliant stations that serve the A train.

### **Problem 3**

Now I will load in a different dataset (pols-month.csv) that contains
information on the political party breakdown of president, senator,
representative and governor positions within the United States from 1947
to 2015.

First, I will clean the data. I will use the separate() function to
break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day. I
will replace month number with month name. I will also create a new
variable called president which will take values gop and dem and replace
columns prez\_dem and prez\_gop. Lastly, I will remove the day variable.

Because ultimately we are interested in merging this dataset with other
datasets, I will arrange this dataset according to year and month, and
organize the data such that year and month are the leading columns. This
formatting is for consistency purposes and will be used in all
subsequent datasets introduced in this problem.

``` r
pols = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  #clean and standardize variable naming convention
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  #break up mon variable into integer variables year, month and day
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), month = as.integer(month), day = as.integer(day)) %>%
  #arrange dataset according to year and month
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  #change month numbers to month names
  mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "January", "2" = "February", "3" = "March", "4" = "April", "5" = "May", "6" = "June", "7" = "July", "8" = "August", "9" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December")) %>%
  #create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove prez_dem and prez_gop variables
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("prez"),
    names_to = "president", 
    values_to = "num") %>%
  mutate(president = recode(president, "prez_gop" = "gop", "prez_dem" = "dem")) %>%
  #remove extraneous num field generated using pivot_longer and day variable
  select(-num, -day) %>%
  #ensure columns year and month are listed first
  select(year, month, everything())
#display table of first 10 rows to show cleaned dataset
head(pols, 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 9
    ##     year month    gov_gop sen_gop rep_gop gov_dem sen_dem rep_dem president
    ##    <int> <chr>      <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>    
    ##  1  1947 January       23      51     253      23      45     198 gop      
    ##  2  1947 January       23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
    ##  3  1947 February      23      51     253      23      45     198 gop      
    ##  4  1947 February      23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
    ##  5  1947 March         23      51     253      23      45     198 gop      
    ##  6  1947 March         23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
    ##  7  1947 April         23      51     253      23      45     198 gop      
    ##  8  1947 April         23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
    ##  9  1947 May           23      51     253      23      45     198 gop      
    ## 10  1947 May           23      51     253      23      45     198 dem

Now I will clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the
above. For consistency across datasets, I will also arrange this
datasets according to year and month, and organize it such that year and
month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp = 
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  #clean and standardize variable naming convention
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  #break up date variable into integer variables year, month and day
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), month = as.integer(month), day = as.integer(day)) %>%
  #arrange dataset according to year and month
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  #change month numbers to month names
  mutate(month = recode(month, "1" = "January", "2" = "February", "3" = "March", "4" = "April", "5" = "May", "6" = "June", "7" = "July", "8" = "August", "9" = "September", "10" = "October", "11" = "November", "12" = "December")) %>%
  #drop the day variable
  select(-day) %>%
  #ensure year and month are leading columns
  select(year, month, everything())
#display table of first 10 rows to show cleaned dataset
head(snp, 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 3
    ##     year month     close
    ##    <int> <chr>     <dbl>
    ##  1  1950 January    17.0
    ##  2  1950 February   17.2
    ##  3  1950 March      17.3
    ##  4  1950 April      18.0
    ##  5  1950 May        18.8
    ##  6  1950 June       17.7
    ##  7  1950 July       17.8
    ##  8  1950 August     18.4
    ##  9  1950 September  19.5
    ## 10  1950 October    19.5

Now I will load in and clean my third and final dataset, unemployment.

``` r
unempl =
  read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  #clean and standardize variable naming convention
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  #create a month variable and switch from "wide" to "long" format to be consistent with other datasets
  pivot_longer(
    cols = jan:dec,
    names_to = "month", 
    values_to = "unemployment") %>%
  #change month naming mechanism to be consistent with other datasets
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
    "jan" = "January", "feb" = "February", "mar" = "March", "apr" = "April", "may" = "May",
    "jun" = "June", "jul" = "July", "aug" = "August", "sep" = "September", "oct" = "October",
    "nov" = "November", "dec" = "December"))
#display table of first 10 rows to show cleaned dataset
head(unempl, 10)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 3
    ##     year month     unemployment
    ##    <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>
    ##  1  1948 January            3.4
    ##  2  1948 February           3.8
    ##  3  1948 March              4  
    ##  4  1948 April              3.9
    ##  5  1948 May                3.5
    ##  6  1948 June               3.6
    ##  7  1948 July               3.6
    ##  8  1948 August             3.9
    ##  9  1948 September          3.8
    ## 10  1948 October            3.7

Now that my data files have been cleaned, I will merge them, beginning
with the pols and snp datasets.

``` r
pols_snp = merge(pols, snp, by = c("year", "month"))
#display table of first 10 rows to show merged dataset
head(pols_snp, 10)
```

    ##    year    month gov_gop sen_gop rep_gop gov_dem sen_dem rep_dem president
    ## 1  1950    April      18      44     177      29      57     269       gop
    ## 2  1950    April      18      44     177      29      57     269       dem
    ## 3  1950   August      18      44     177      29      57     269       gop
    ## 4  1950   August      18      44     177      29      57     269       dem
    ## 5  1950 December      18      44     177      29      57     269       gop
    ## 6  1950 December      18      44     177      29      57     269       dem
    ## 7  1950 February      18      44     177      29      57     269       gop
    ## 8  1950 February      18      44     177      29      57     269       dem
    ## 9  1950  January      18      44     177      29      57     269       gop
    ## 10 1950  January      18      44     177      29      57     269       dem
    ##    close
    ## 1  17.96
    ## 2  17.96
    ## 3  18.42
    ## 4  18.42
    ## 5  20.43
    ## 6  20.43
    ## 7  17.22
    ## 8  17.22
    ## 9  17.05
    ## 10 17.05

Now I will merge the unemployment dataset in as well.

``` r
fin_merge = merge(pols_snp, unempl, by = c("year", "month"))
#display table of first 10 rows to show merged dataset
head(fin_merge, 10)
```

The final merged dataset, containing data from the pols, snp and unempl
datasets, has 1572 rows and 11 columns. It contains monthly political
party breakdowns for elected US government positions, including
president, senator, representative and governor positions, from 1947 to
2015. This data was pulled from the pols dataset.

The final merged dataset also includes monthly unemployment rates from
the unempl datset, and S\&P stock index closing values from the snp
dataset. Like the party breakdown data, these data are reported monthly
from 1947 to 2015.
